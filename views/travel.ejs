      <p class="lead" style="font-size: 15px">Conveniently located near Seoul, Gangchon Rail Park used to be a servicable train station but is now a railbike tourist attraction that connects two closed station platforms, Gimyujeong Station and Gangchon Station. In fall, follow the Gangchon railway to see colorful foliage of fields and forests. You will also pass through Bubble Tunnel and Musical Tunnel, and even see Bukhangang River along the way! The railbike track is approximately 6km long, with the remaining journey of 2.5km completed by the Romantic Train. When you arrive at Gangchon station, you can either move on to the next attraction or return to Gimyujeong Station by the free shuttle bus provided.
